# Collection-view-test

When a CollectionView renders a childView, both it and the childView lose their
controller bindings.

To view this bug:

* Open the EmberInspector and observe
the Ember.CollectionView (note that it will be initially bound to the
application controller).
* Next, click the "Add View" button.
* Note that Ember.CollectionView and its childView now do not have any
controller binding.
